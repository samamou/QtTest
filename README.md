LivePose is a command line tool, the user changes config files by hand

Objective: Create a Qt/QMP User Interface for LivePose to generate JSON config files 

## Process

- install Qt, Qt Creator (interpreter: python3 compatible with Pyslide)

## Workflow

1. User enters a configuration in the UI
2. UI sends data to python (when does the ui trigger a python function?)
3. Python to generate JSON file
4. JSON file used in LivePose
